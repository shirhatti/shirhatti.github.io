# Repository settings managed by https://github.com/repository-settings/app
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This app escalates anyone with push access to effectively have
# admin privileges, since pushing changes to this file on the default branch
# auto-applies them. The CODEOWNERS file auto-requests the owner as reviewer,
# and a PR warning workflow posts a caution comment on config-changing PRs.
#
# If collaborators are added later, re-enable required_pull_request_reviews
# in the branch protection section below to enforce code-owner sign-off.
