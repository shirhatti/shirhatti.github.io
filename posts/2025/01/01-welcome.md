Welcome to my Terminal Blog
===========================

If you're reading this, you've found my corner of the internet.

This blog is designed for people who spend most of their day in a
terminal. No fancy CSS frameworks, no JavaScript bloat — just plain
text rendered the way nature intended.

Commands you should try:
  ls -l       list posts with details
  cat <post>  read a post (bat-style formatting!)
  help        see all commands
  about       learn more about me

Happy reading!
